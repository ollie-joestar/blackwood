```
Rain lashes against the windows as your carriage rattles up the gravel path. Ahead, Blackwood Hall looms from the mist—a silhouette of turrets, chimneys, and stern stone. 
The manor seems to frown down at you, its great iron doors waiting silently.
A butler in black stands at attention beneath a flickering gaslight. 
“Welcome,” he says with no warmth. “Lord Blackwood has requested your discretion… though I fear you may be too late.”

## 🏰 Manor Locations & Clues

### 📚 The Study (Crime Scene)

```
The door creaks open into a room heavy with tobacco and secrets. Lord Blackwood sits slumped in his high-backed chair, a pistol dangling from his hand. 
A glass of red wine is spilled across a letter on his desk. His expression is fixed in a strange, rigid grimace.
There’s no sign of a struggle, no broken furniture or forced entry. Just the silence—and the storm outside.
```

> [!note]
> **Description**  
> Locked from inside. Oak desk, spilled wine, pistol in Blackwood's hand. Fireplace recently used.

> [!important]
> **Clues**

> • Torn journal page: "*The dreams return. I know someone is watching me.*"  
> • Fireplace ashes contain scraps: "*...inheritance...not safe...daughter...*"  
> • Hidden safe (Investigation DC 17) – New will leaves estate to “E.C.”

### 💃 Ballroom

```
Moonlight filters through tall arched windows, glinting off the shattered edges of a ballroom mirror. Velvet curtains sway gently in the draft. 
The room is mostly empty now—only the occasional whisper or shoe echoing against the marble floor.
A forgotten dance card flutters by your feet. Perfume still hangs in the air—sweet, but cloying.
```

> [!note]
> **Description**

> • Loose floorboard – Old love letters signed by “Evangelina”

### 🛏️ Guest Rooms

```
Each guest room reveals its own secrets: love letters folded beneath pillows, drawers that don’t quite shut, and masks tossed onto chairs like discarded truths. 
The walls feel closer here, the air heavier. Somewhere, a clock chimes ten. The night deepens.
